# kaggle-digit-recognizer

My work for the kaggle competition [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) in which handwritten greyscale digits from the MNIST dataset must be recognised. I wrote a class to visualise the effect of each layer in a Tensorflow/keras convolutional neural network to solve this problem, which is described in the kaggle kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jack89roberts/the-journey-of-an-image-through-a-neural-network)
